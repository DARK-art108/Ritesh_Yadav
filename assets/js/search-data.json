For each question type (see below), Create nice reusable question templates with few examples. . Fill in the blanks | MCQs | True or False / Boolean | Multi-choice/Multiple Fill in the blanks | . Question templates are a combination of prompt tokens and question phrases. For the question generation task &quot;Few&quot; in the phrase &quot;few examples&quot; depends on the question type. For instance you will witness for Fill in the lanks and MCQs 2 examples works just fine. For True or False you could just go with 1 example and May be in your experiments you may discover Zero-short can be put to best use for your needs. . Note: . Here examples simply mean string templates of some static knowledge put together to match the desired Question (and answer) style. | Having categories of templates can help, because the closer your templates are with the actual paragraphs you are using to generate question in terms of domains the stronger will be the generation results. | . Disclaimer: . The strength and quality of your generations are a function of your Prompt Tokens and Example phrases. Choose creative yet relevant prompt tokens. | PROMPT PROGRAMMING is a SKILL you can improve purely by TRIAL AND ERROR with your ENGLISH knowledge. | . 1. Fill in the blanks . Below is a sample prompt template for Fill in the blank questions As said before the examples are based on the some static knowledge. Here we have 2 &lt;Paragraph/Ques-Ans&gt; pairs.

            "content": "Introduction . More data can help train models to be more general, with less overfitting. One convenient way to generate additional data is simply to transform the given data into something slightly different, such that it still represents the assigned labels. As well as helping during training, augmentation can also be used when running inference (Test Time Augmentation or TTA). . For an image based challenge, flips, rotations, etc. can be used to generate a new image that still presents the same class of object as the original. But how do we do this for a NLP challenge? . There are a wide variety of approaches, from character and word substitutions, all the way to translating the text from the source lanaguage to another and then back to get a setence with (hopefully) the same meaning, but a different structure. . For more info, vad13irt has already posted a great survey here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/feedback-prize-2021/discussion/295277 . For this notebook, I want to focus on what the application of some of these methods actually looks like for the feedback-prize-2021 dataset.

Original: 1105 Dear Senator, I favor keeping the Electoral College in the arguement. One of the reasons I feel that way is that it is harder for someone who is runnig for president to win. To win they would need to win over the votes of most of the small states. Or win over the votes over some of the small states and some of the big states.  So it would need someone who is smart or at least somewhat smart. Another one of my reasons for going on this side of the arguement is not only do they have to win over the electoral votes they have to win over the poularity votes. The next reason I have is the Electoral College requires the people running for president they have appeal to all regions and not just the west because they were born there or something like that. Now there are a few bad things about the Electoral College. Like one is the fact that a tie is posible. Another is that it&#39;s out dated. Lastly each party picks a slate of electors to vote for the party&#39;s nominee and it&#39;s posible that trust can be betrayed, but that&#39;s rare.
