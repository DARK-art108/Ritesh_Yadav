            "content": "Introduction . More data can help train models to be more general, with less overfitting. One convenient way to generate additional data is simply to transform the given data into something slightly different, such that it still represents the assigned labels. As well as helping during training, augmentation can also be used when running inference (Test Time Augmentation or TTA). . For an image based challenge, flips, rotations, etc. can be used to generate a new image that still presents the same class of object as the original. But how do we do this for a NLP challenge? . There are a wide variety of approaches, from character and word substitutions, all the way to translating the text from the source lanaguage to another and then back to get a setence with (hopefully) the same meaning, but a different structure. . For more info, vad13irt has already posted a great survey here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/feedback-prize-2021/discussion/295277 . For this notebook, I want to focus on what the application of some of these methods actually looks like for the feedback-prize-2021 dataset. In particular, I&#39;ll be looking at methods that can be used while preserving the discourse_start and discourse_end annotations given in train.csv. . The nlpaug Package . I have chosen the nlpaug package, as it seems to have all I could want to experiement with. I could just have used &#39;pip install nlpaug&#39;, but I&#39;ve installed it from a dataset to allow this notebook to run with internet turned off. .

For this I&#39;ve picked a very simple augmetation, KeyboardAug, that uses adjacency of keys on the keyboard to simulate typos. Alongside the original and annotated text, I&#39;m printing the length of the text run through split() - if that changes the discourse_start and discourse_end annotations given in train.csv will no longer be valid. . from colorama import Fore from pathlib import Path # Set some seeds.

Original: 1105 Dear Senator, I favor keeping the Electoral College in the arguement. One of the reasons I feel that way is that it is harder for someone who is runnig for president to win. To win they would need to win over the votes of most of the small states. Or win over the votes over some of the small states and some of the big states.  So it would need someone who is smart or at least somewhat smart. Another one of my reasons for going on this side of the arguement is not only do they have to win over the electoral votes they have to win over the poularity votes. The next reason I have is the Electoral College requires the people running for president they have appeal to all regions and not just the west because they were born there or something like that. Now there are a few bad things about the Electoral College. Like one is the fact that a tie is posible. Another is that it&#39;s out dated. Lastly each party picks a slate of electors to vote for the party&#39;s nominee and it&#39;s posible that trust can be betrayed, but that&#39;s rare.

The length of the split text has changed as the original had additional white space for formatting. | It is hard to see all the differences without highlighting. | The augmentation adds digits and special characters, which are unlikely to have been present. | The augmentation can change many characters in one word, making the new word too far from the original. | The augmented text adds spaces around apostrophes, increasing the split length. | Let&#39;s solve these by: . Stripping the original text. | Adding a diff viewer to highlight the differences. | Setting arguments to the augmentation method. | Setting arguments to the augmentation method. | Post-processing the augmented text with: replace(&quot; &#39; &quot;, &quot;&#39;&quot;) | sample = &quot; &quot;.join([x.strip() for x in sample.split()]) . def print_and_highlight_diff(orig_text, new_texts): &quot;&quot;&quot; A simple diff viewer for augmented texts. &quot;&quot;&quot; orig_split = orig_text.split() print(f&quot;Original: {len(orig_split)} n{orig_text} n&quot;) for new_text in new_texts: print(f&quot;Augmented: {len(new_text.split())}&quot;) for i, word in enumerate(new_text.split()): if i &lt; len(orig_split) and word == orig_split[i]: print(word, end=&quot; &quot;) else: print(Fore.RED + word + Fore.RESET, end=&quot; &quot;) print() .

So it would need loser who is smart or at least somewhat smart. Another part of my reasons for going on this side onto the arguement is not only do they have to win over the electoral votes they have and win over the poularity votes. The next reason I think is the Electoral College requires the people running for president they have appeal to all regions and not just the west because they were born there or something like that. Now there are a few bad things about the Electoral College. Like one is the fact that a tie is posible. Which is that it&#39;s out dated. Lastly each party picks a slate of electors to vote for the party&#39;s nominee and it&#39;s posible that trust can be betrayed, but that&#39;s rare. That is what I think about the Electoral College. Augmented: 208 Dear Senator, we favor keeping the Electoral College in the arguement. One of the reasons I feel that way is that it is uncommon for someone who is runnig for president to win. To win they would need to win over the votes of each of the small states. So win over the votes over some of the small states and some of the big families. So it would need someone who is smart or at least somewhat smart. Another one of my reasons for deciding on this side of the arguement is not only do they have to win over the electoral votes they have to win over the poularity votes. The main reason I have why the Electoral College requires the people running for president they have appeal to all regions and not just the west because they were born there or something like that.

Augmented: 208 Dear Senator, I favor keeping the Electoral College in the arguement. One of the reasons I feel that way is that it is harder for someone who is runnig for them to win. By win they would need to win over the votes of most of the small states. Or win over the votes over some of the small states and some of the big states. So it would need someone who is smart or at least somewhat smart. Another one of my reasons for going on this side of the arguement is not just do they have to win over the electoral votes they have to win over the poularity votes. The next reason I have is the Electoral College requires the people running for president they have appeal to all races and not just the west so they were born there or something like that. Now there are a few bad things about the Electoral College. Like one is the fact when each tie is posible. Another is that that&#39;s out dated. Today each party picks a slate of electors that vote for the party&#39;s nominee and it&#39;s posible that trust can be betrayed, but that&#39;s rare. That is what I think about the Electoral College. .",

          "content": "I am primarily interested in Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and DevOps. My key skills are Text Generation, Prompt Generation, Semantic Similarity ,Object Detection, Amazon Web Services.I am also intrested in building end to end operation pipelines for productionizing of AI Models.I have also used various DevOps tools like Terraform,Kubernetes, Docker, Jenkins, Tensorflow Extended, Kubeflow, Apache Kafka and also have a experience in various databases like MongoDB, Postgres, MySQL, Redis, TimeScaleDB , Firebase, etc. . I advocate for highly readable and self-contained code. Python is what I primarily use for programming. I am proficient in TensorFlow and a beginner in PyTorch. I usually train models on Google Colab Notebook and on my local workstation(Acer Predator-RTX 3060). Apart from this I also love to participate in various Kaggle Competitions and hackathons. . I am currently working as a Junior Data Scientist at Ineuron.ai where I am working on building a Natural Language Processing model and deploying them to Cloud Platform like AWS, GCP, Azure. . I have contributed to various F/OSS projects. In particular, I have made contributions to Porter, Meshery, Thanos-io, and Tensorflow. Off the work, I like writing technical articles, working on applied Machine Learning ideas,Deploying and Scaling ML Models and giving talks at developer meetups and conferences. . | | | | .
